# Project Agent Rules

- The application root is `game/`.
- The stack is Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, Pinia, and Phaser.
- Do not use `any` unless it is genuinely necessary.
- Do not change architecture or add dependencies unless the task requires it.
- Do not edit files outside the task scope.
- Prefer focused changes to rewrites.
- Never read or expose local secrets such as `APIKey` or `.env` files.
- Do not commit, push, deploy, or perform destructive Git operations.
- Run relevant tests, `npm.cmd run type-check`, and `npm.cmd run build` before declaring completion.
- Fix verification failures caused by the implementation.
- Summaries must state what changed, what was verified, and any remaining limitations.

## Development Phase

- This project is currently in a development build. Save-migration correctness does NOT need to be maintained or verified — it is fine to break compatibility with old saves during this phase. Do not spend effort on save migrations.
